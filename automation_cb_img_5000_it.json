    "In particular, those involved in research and development will see the newly implemented systems as of special relevance to automation.",
    "Our goal is to develop a generally applicable feedback method that is better suited for the flexible automation of microassembly processes.",

    "Introduction and software agents supporting decision-making and maintenance is the main challenge for research and applications of a cost effective automation.",
    "Because the grammar rules encapsulate the feasible additions that can be made, the automation is based simply on choosing a series of applicable rules."
