    "Observers have been on vessels engaged in the anchovy, bass, herring, mackerel, pilchard, smelt and sprat fisheries.",

    "Some of them are species in which our industry has no particular interest—anchovies, for example.",
    "Anchovy fishing remained closely regulated, however.",
    "This scheme, however, cannot be used in the case of anchovy cones due their lack of symmetry, and thus, we do not have an accurate account of cell thickness.",
    "Most fishes must be fed with other fish meat such as prawns, mussels, anchovy and sprats.",
    "The latter problem was compounded by the intermittent prohibition of anchovy and pilchard fishing between early-1986 and late1988, this re-ignited tensions between the private and public sectors.",
    "Yet it is, because those anchovy shoals are one of the main sources of the world's fishmeal protein supply."
