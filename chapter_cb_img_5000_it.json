    "This chapter is particularly interesting for the detailed case studies that follow, which illustrate the changes that children's phonological systems undergo during treatment.",
    "In every chapter the narrative is given colour by local case studies from urban and rural congregations, brief vignettes of church leaders and telling incidents.",
    "This chapter includes a significant amount of technical information that may be beyond the nonspecialist audience.",
    "The chapters illustrate a range of methods, although there is an overall emphasis in favour of qualitative approaches.",
    "The extensive chapter on abolition, for example, skims over modes of liberation, the roles of families and post-liberation livelihoods.",
    "Chapter five is again a rather theoretical one because the author deals with different types of policy and policy-making, policy analysis and electoral systems.",
    "Some chapters remain mired in highly technical language, while others fail to transcend the limited social, cultural contexts of their studies.",
    "These and other themes are developed in six substantive chapters."
