    "Large bait treatment combinations were housed in whole milk cartons (as for carton-bases, above), holed twice on two sides (all holes 2 cm diameter).",
    "This was due to the fragility of the milk carton traps; they were trampled by sheep and kangaroos, and could be eaten completely in less than four weeks.",
    "Workings within the baits were lined with loose soil and black carton.",
    "Bookbinders could use his discovery and carton-makers would be impressed by his paper's durability.",
    "These have since been somewhat improved - through a combination of carpet and egg cartons!",
    "They encased baits with coarse, external soil coverings and the large chambers and galleries excavated were lined with black faecal carton.",
    "Their labels for the objects included words such as \"ashtray\" (frequency: 161), \"casserole\" (frequency: 94), and \"carton\" (frequency: 83).",
    "Twenty carton-bases were left completely undisturbed to measure abandonment caused by bait placement and inspection."
