    "Up to the 1970s the singers were usually, although with notable exceptions, the composers of vallenato as well as the accordion players.",
    "Polyphonic instruments include pianos, guitars, violins, accordions and xylophones.",
    "Gramophone now also recorded an increasing number of comic singers and accordion players.",
    "In version 3, the first section is marked piano and features a static dissonant accompaniment for two flutes, accordion and piano.",
    "Like an accordion, the genre can expand from the school to the discipline, and then to the profession.",
    "The scoring of this work is mainly for woodwind and brass, including euphonium plus harp, accordion, piano doubling synthesiser, percussion and electric guitar.",
    "Although the size of the user group was small (five unpaid subjects), a relatively wide range of musical experience was represented, ranging from an accordion player to a music teacher.",
    "Moreover, the accordion becomes the signifying sonority of a sung genre whose lyrical and narrative characteristics come to represent one of its highest aesthetic values."
