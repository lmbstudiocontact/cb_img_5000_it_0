    "From the several commemorative photo albums of the city published in the 1880s, street lights appear to have been installed on many streets some time before they were paved.",
    "We thus now turn to look more directly at emergent forms of consumption, principally as embodied in a number of extremely popular compilation albums of current hits.",
    "About thirty per cent of the albums were recorded in the 1970s, twenty per cent in the 1990s.",
    "Additionally, it is important to note a high state of stability in the canon: thirteen albums are among the top twenty both in columns two and three.",
    "Few albums can have come with such an extensive framing.",
    "The albums can also be seen as documents that reflected as well as permitted increased control.",
    "If a visual representation of sameness and belonging encouraged identification with characters and with singers, it also presumably encouraged the acquisition of sheet music, albums and tickets.",
    "We mused upon the possibility that the photographs could be pasted into albums and that police officers could while away long winter nights turning the pages and admiring these mugshots."
