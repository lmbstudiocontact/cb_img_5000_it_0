    "Yes, but a reduction in the number of bonuses is unavoidable.",
    "Such bonuses should be inversely related in amount to the man's age.",
    "Contrastingly, bonuses are transfer payments and not resource costs, so that their payment does not subtract from national output (except for costs of administration).",
    "The preferred role of bonuses depends very much on the stage a family planning programme has reached.",
    "Any government that offers bonuses wishes to ensure that it is in fact obtaining the fertility reductions for which it is ostensibly paying.",
    "In contrast, life companies have their capital as a cushion against errors, and also non-guaranteed bonuses on variable policies.",
    "If they lose only their bonuses, they will find themselves in a substandard situation in terms of take-home pay, and back in the past.",
    "However, according to calculations presented below, bonuses for having a vasectomy could well be many times larger than now offered by most government programmes."
