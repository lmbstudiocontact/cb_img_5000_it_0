    "The present study was per formed in order to define the time structure of the seed pulse that will be fed into the power amplifier.",

    "The electrode tip was positioned next to the soma and penetration was achieved using the amplifier's buzz feature.",
    "As a result, large apertures are required for excimer amplifiers to obtain output power high enough.",
    "In addition, the analysis also includes intensifiers, such as universal and negative pronouns (all, nothing), amplifiers (a lot, forever), and emphatics (extreme/-ly/, total/-ly/).",
    "The overall frequency response of hot-wire and amplifiers was flat from 20 to 20,000 c/s, provided the compensation was properly adjusted.",
    "In the second step, six several terawatt lasers are expected to be obtained by simultaneous amplification of the six beams of the e-beam pumped amplifiers.",
    "A sinusoidal signal from a function generator was amplified in an audio amplifier before it was fed to the speaker."
