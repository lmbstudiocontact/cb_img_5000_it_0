    "The first is the potential complexity required to both reason about the bidding process and determine the auction's outcome.",
    "Such auctions are known to have taken place as far back as the 1830s, if not before.",
    "We suggest that providing better information to the beneficiaries, as well as allowing for market auctions where appropriate (for large tracts of land, for example) may also help.",
    "In contrast, suppose that the process of biological evolution would select bidding strategies for auctions that take place generation after generation in a population in which strategies are genetically inherited.",
    "However, the variegated and inconsistent lessons drawn from their participation indicate that the role game theorists actually played in the auctions is not well understood.",
    "One of the issues in the private rented sector is that properties with sitting [regulated] tenants can be sold off, passed on, or auctioned many times.",
    "Typical examples of complex distributed applications are social simulations, supply-chain management, electronic auctions, e-institutions, or business-to-business applications.",
    "When human or arti®cial agents negotiate in auctions they do not necessarily require speech acts and logic to carry out sophisticated transactions."
